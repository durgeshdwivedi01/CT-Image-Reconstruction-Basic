# CT Image Reconstructions

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of various CT image reconstruction techniques including Back Projection, Filtered Back Projection, Fourier-based Reconstruction, and Iterative (SIRT) Reconstruction.

## Description

This tool creates a phantom image and generates a sinogram by simulating the X-ray transmission through the phantom at different angles. It then performs various reconstruction techniques to recreate the original image from the sinogram.

## Usage

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `CT_Image_Reconstruction.m`.
3. Run `CT_Image_Reconstruction.m`.
